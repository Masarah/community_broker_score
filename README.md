# Community Broker Score

The community broker score quantifies nodes' potential reach and control at the meso level, while accounting for individual position changes due to different community structures. It was developed in the paper: "A Robust Measure to Uncover Community Brokerage in Illicit Networks" and published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology. 


To install the package and caculate the score for one community structure: 

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Community-Broker-Score
